now for a longer form explanation
the rules of the game are simple

each degen pays for the ticket to join the game
the ticket funds the prize pool minus a 2% fee to the creators.

if no degens join the game for 24 hours, the game starts

after the game starts, EACH DEGEN HAS TO CALL THE GM FUNCTION BEFORE THE TIMER ENDS
if they don't, they will be deleted and lose all their pooled $degen

the timer starts at 24 hours and decreases by 1 hour every day
after 24 days the timer stays constant at 1 hour

this means that after 24 days of gameplay, each degen has 1 hour to call the gm function again, if they don't another degen can remove them from the game

deleting a degen pays a bounty to the hunter, 10% of the ticket price of each degen deleted

if a degen wants to give up, he can commit Seppuku and get a 10% refund of their ticket price 

last degen alive takes *all* the pooled $degen
